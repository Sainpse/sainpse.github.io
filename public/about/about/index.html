<hr>
<p>I have worked on a variety of software projects mostly in the financial industry</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<p><strong>Realtime Applications</strong> (e.g a system that scores the users spending pattern and credit history in order to pre-approve and offer them an increase in their credit limit in real time)</p>
<p>    The Technology Stack Used:
        • Used Visual studio code on the Windows Subsystem for Linux for development
        • Database postgress &amp; MongoDB
        • Apache Kafka and Java for real time event streaming and processing
        • Python for credit model scoring with (Tensorflow)
        • Deployed on OpenShift
        • Communication between different components was done via the Restful API
        • Used Git for version control
        • Used Jira for project management
        • Used Confluence for documentation
        • Used Bamboo for CI/CD
        • Used SonarQube for code quality
        • Used Grafana for monitoring
        • Docker for containerizartion
       
<strong>Full Stack Web Development</strong>. (e.g An intranet for logging and triggering real time campaigns)</p>
<p>    The Technology Stack Used Unique to this project:
        • React for the front end
        • HTML and CSS
        • C# for the backend
        • MySQL for the database
        • SAS for the data analytics</p>
<p><strong>Scheduler</strong> (e.g A scheduler that schedules the execution of of anti-money laundering checks on a daily basis using machine learning)</p>
<p>    The Technology Stack used are already mentioned above python being the main language</p>
<p><strong>API development</strong> (From ensuring security to monitoring performance)</p>
<p><strong>Machine Learning</strong> Models (Developed various machine learning algorithms from Reinforcement Learning to Bayesian Models and serving them on cloud)</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Most of my work has been mostly done in Python, Java, VS code as an IDE and Git for version control. Although Iv worked on mostly windows in my professional roles and switched to WSL as soon as it was available and stable. My preferred OS for dev is Ubuntu. Regarding databases I have been exposed to MySQL, MongoDB, Postgress and Tigergraph on my recent role.</p>

<h2 id="describe-your-experience-building-large-systems-with-many-services---web-front-ends-rest-apis-data-stores-event-processing-and-other-kinds-of-integration-between-components-what-are-the-key-things-to-think-about-in-regard-to-architecture-maintainability-and-reliability-in-these-large-systems">Describe your experience building large systems with many services - web front ends, REST APIs, data stores, event processing and other kinds of integration between components. What are the key things to think about in regard to architecture, maintainability, and reliability in these large systems?</h2>
<p>The first thing that comes in mind regarding my experience building large systems is microservices architecture, agility, modularizatrion and continues delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Microservices Architecture</strong> (Lego Blocks)
This architecture is well suited for large systems because it allows a team to build the system as well defined modules which are easy to understand, maintain, independently deploy and reuse in other similar projects. I think of it as lego blocks which can be rearranged for different programs.</p>
<p>In my previous role we used openshift to deploy our microservices which is a relatively easier platform for the kubernetes cluster. The micorservice allowed me and my team to quickly isolate and fix issues without any downtime for the entire system. Furthermore this allowed me to utilize diferent programming languages strength for certain components.</p>
<p><strong>REST APIs for Communication between the microservices</strong>
In my current and past positions the rest API approach has been a good communication layer to intergrate different specialized components. Its stateless property improves the performance and reliablity because we do not have to deal with server-side state synchronization logic. Further more the layered architecture for rest api&rsquo;s allows us to place a proxy or load balancer btween the client and the server and thus improving scalability. Finally using JSON web tokens to allow secure communication between components</p>
<p><strong>Data Stores</strong>
One of the key things to also consider is the type of format, volume, velocity and feature set for data requirments for the system in question. For instance on one of my large projects we had data that required high intergrity and relationships to be strictly enforced using DB constraints which required us to use a relational database like postgress. On the other hand for intergrating are a portion of complex data structures that evolve we used MongoDB to maintain a high-performing system and agility. This is why the microservice architecture is well suited for large system, given it can support a hybrid dat model of any tech stack to archieve a goal effeciently.</p>
<p><strong>DevOps</strong>
This is crucial expecialy to maintain order, synchronization and continouse delivery between different teams working on different services for the system. Each component release must be evaluated and impact analysis needs to be done on every other component that depends on it. Additionaly monitoring tools like grafana which I have worked with need to be incorporated for continuous feedback on speed and failures for further improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Web frontends</strong>
Although my exprience is mostly has on the backend, data and the anaytics layer I have heard my fair share of web apps development. I know the UI/UX has to be intuitive and fast. Hence all having data processing should be done in the backend and served to the frontend. the technology frameworks I have used is react, redux for session management and your typical javascript, HTML and CSS for styling.</p>
<h3 id="describe-your-experience-with-go-outline-the-applications-that-you-have-worked-on-in-go-and-your-takeaways-from-that-experience">Describe your experience with Go. Outline the applications that you have worked on in Go and your takeaways from that experience.</h3>
<p>Unfortunetly I do not have any professional exprience with go. However it is a launguage like many others  that I can quickly adopt when I need to do so. through out my career I have done this before with languages like C# for a dependent legacy system that needed to be updated.</p>
<h3 id="describe-your-experience-with-python-outline-the-applications-that-you-have-worked-on-in-python-and-your-takeaways-from-that-experience">Describe your experience with Python. Outline the applications that you have worked on in Python and your takeaways from that experience.</h3>
<p>My career thus far has evolved around python. has an outline of projects I have used for python and key take aways.</p>
<p><strong>An algorithmic trading system that utilizes Reinforcement Learning (DQN)</strong>
The automanted systems integrated with 2 brokers and uses a different service to stream real time data. It also inlcuded a risk and portfolio management sub systems. I have built it end-to-end. One biggetest take away I took from it which is well know is the slow speed of the language.</p>
<p>This taught me to always consider my algorithmic performance and optimize where I can use techniques like multi-threading, parallel processing or simply developing a specialized package that uses a faster language like c for a specific function. However I love its simplicity because it allows one ot focus on the problem their are trying to solve.</p>
<p><strong>Other projects I have used python in are</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Real time credit  scoring system</li>
<li>Entity resolution models.</li>
<li>Anti fraud models and the associate back end to serve the results to the frontend</li>
<li>Data streaming python package</li>
<li>telegram chat bot</li>
<li>API layers using the Fast API package</li>
<li>Automating tasks</li>
<li>scheduler</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="----how-comprehensive-would-you-say-your-knowledge-of-a-linux-distribution-is-how-have-you-gained-this-knowledge">-   How comprehensive would you say your knowledge of a Linux distribution is? How have you gained this knowledge?</h3>
<p>I would say I have a working knowledge given I use it every time I can for development. I initially gained it by developing on WSL for windows and once I fell in love I started to fully use it as an OS on my personal PC.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-your-proudest-success-as-an-engineer">What is your proudest success as an engineer?</h3>
<p>My proudest success as an engineer for me is exposing my self to a wide array of technology stacks from every layer at young age. which currently gives me the confidence to able to jump and any specielized development team an add value.  However in teams of what I built at the moment is the real time triggered credit scoring system built at the back. It was a tough journey however given its success was huge and made the back so much money. It was worth it and I am proud of it.</p>
<h3 id="would-you-describe-yourself-as-a-strong-engineer-why">Would you describe yourself as a strong engineer? Why?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. This goes back to my proudest success as an egineer. The ability to jump in every enviroment even I have not touch any of the tech stack. I can quickly adabt and add value in a short period of time due to my diverse expirience</p>

Which were your strengths and which were the most enjoyable? How did you rank, competitively, in these subjects</h3>
<p>I was usually one of the top performers. Consitently so in especially in computing and mathematics. I ranked in the range from top 10 to top 3 and sometimes the top performer in class.</p>
<h3 id="what-sort-of-high-school-student-were-you-outside-of-required-work-what-were-your-interests-and-hobbies-what-would-your-high-school-peers-remember-you-for-if-we-asked-them">What sort of high school student were you? Outside of required work, what were your interests and hobbies? What would your high school peers remember you for, if we asked them?</h3>
<p>My interests was mostly reading science fiction books and drawing. Hence if you asked my peers they will remember me as a &ldquo;nerd&rdquo; and some an simply and artist</p>
<h3 id="in-languages-and-the-arts-at-high-school-what-were-your-strongest-subjects-and-how-did-you-rank-in-those-among-your-school-peers">In languages and the arts at high school, what were your strongest subjects and how did you rank in those among your school peers?</h3>
<p>For languages I was above average but not typically the best. Arts I was occusionally in the top ten performers. My strongest subject in the arts was graphic design.</p>
<h3 id="please-outline-some-high-school-achievements-considered-exceptional-by-peers-and-staff-members">Please outline some high school achievements considered exceptional by peers and staff members.</h3>
<p>Solving a tetiary mathematical problem in a short space of time during the science adventure camp challenge. The teachers were not expecting a correct answer from any of the learners but wanted to see who can get close enough to the solution.</p>
<h3 id="which-degree-and-university-did-you-choose-and-why">Which degree and university did you choose and why?</h3>
<p>Computer science and Informatics.
I choose it because I wanted to learn something that will allow me to learn and contribute to every other field of study. Computer Science is proving to be the best field for that given most disciplines use some form of computer software to research and advance the field.</p>
<p>Addtionally I was fascinated about the idea of artificail intelligence and I saw it as a way to augment human abilities and to understand ourselves more. Lastly the idea of information always seemed like a much more deeper concept than what people general see it as.</p>
<h3 id="what-did-you-enjoy-most-about-your-time-at-university">What did you enjoy most about your time at university?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Collaborations with other students from different fields</li>
<li>Interacting and making friends with international students</li>
<li>Simply my computer science lectures and other random lectures outside my study I will occusionally attend</li>
</ul>

What is it about the company&rsquo;s purpose and goals which is most appealing to you? What do you find risky or unappealing? Are there any elements of the company goals that you are unsure about?</h3>
<p>The companies goal to bring software for free to the wide audience is something that resonates with my desire to help and collaborate with others to accelarate innovation. In short the most apoealing goal about the company is accelarated innovation through global collaboration.</p>
<p>The fact the openess is part of the companies culture, this proves that only good is intendent for the greater public.</p>
<p>The only risk I see with the goal is exploitation from more secretive organisations.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-you-most-want-to-work-for-canonical">Why do you most want to work for Canonical?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The companies goal resonates with my desire to help and collaborate with a diverse set of great minds.</li>
<li>The fact that it has South African roots makes me super proud and I want to contribute to the the journey as a South African</li>
