### Introduction

The human mind is a complex and fascinating thing, capable of great feats of creativity and intelligence that have long astounded humanity. From the timeless works of Shakespeare to the revolutionary scientific theories of Einstein, the human brain has consistently demonstrated its incredible abilities. But what is it about the human mind that allows it to do these things? And how can we use this knowledge to create more advanced forms of artificial intelligence? In this article, we'll delve into the fascinating connection between the human brain and AI, and consider the profound implications of this relationship for our understanding of intelligence. So grab a cup of coffee and let's explore the world of AI and the human brain together.

### Neurons

Artificial neurons, also known as perceptrons, are inspired by biological neurons found in the human brain. These biological neurons are cells that transmit information through electrical and chemical signals, receiving input signals from other neurons and using them to produce output signals that are sent to other neurons or to muscles or glands in the body.

The structure of a perceptron is relatively simple, consisting of a set of input connections that receive input signals from other neurons, and a single output connection that sends the output signal to other neurons or to muscles or glands in the body. The input connections are weighted, meaning that each input signal is multiplied by a weight factor before it is processed by the perceptron. The perceptron also has a bias, which is a constant value that is added to the weighted sum of the input signals. Together, these elements allow the perceptron to process input signals and produce output signals in a manner similar to biological neuron.

**Side Note**: I asked an AI dialog model by [Open AI](https://open.ai) to create 3 qoutes about the similarity between artificial neurons and biological neurons. Here are the results.

> " The connections between the human brain and artificial intelligence may seem distant and tenuous, but they are in fact deeply intertwined, bound together by the shared pursuit of knowledge and understanding." 


> " The human brain may be the most complex and powerful computing machine in the known universe, but even it is not immune to the march of progress and the potential of artificial intelligence. "


> " The marriage of the human mind and artificial intelligence may be fraught with challenges and obstacles, but it holds the potential to unlock new heights of knowledge and achievement that were once thought impossible."
