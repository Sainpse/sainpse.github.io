## Introduction

  #### Definition of Artificial Intelligence/Augmented Intelligence
  Imagine having a super smart computer that can do all the tasks you hate doing, like filling out your taxes or heloing you come up with new ideas. That's essentially what artificial intelligence, or AI, is all about.

  #### Overview of the history of AI
  It's hard to believe that the idea of creating intelligent machines has been around since ancient myths and legends. But it wasn't until the 20th century that the field of AI really started to take off. Early AI research focused on creating algorithms and programs that could replicate human thought processes and problem-solving abilities. Fast forward to today, and AI has become a household name, encompassing everything from voice recognition to machine learning to robotics. But as with any new technology, there are always ethical concerns and debates to be had. Will AI take over our jobs? (to some degree is already is) Only time will tell. Although I personally think it will augment our intelligence in a way that will  allow us to think on higher thought dimensions.

## Ancient History

  #### Mythical stories and legends about intelligent machines
  Many ancient cultures had myths and legends about intelligent machines or mechanical beings. For example, in Greek mythology, there was the story of Pygmalion, who created a statue of a woman that was brought to life by the gods. In Hindu mythology, there was the legend of Vishwakarma, the divine engineer who created the world and all the beings in it. These stories suggest that the idea of creating intelligent machines has been around for a long time.
  #### Early philosophical discussions of the possibility of creating intelligent machines 
  In addition to mythical stories, there have also been early philosophical discussions about the possibility of creating intelligent machines. For example, in the 4th century BC, the Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote about the idea of automata, or self-moving machines, in his work "On the Heavens." In the 17th century, the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz also proposed the idea of creating a universal machine that could perform any calculation. These early discussions show that the concept of creating intelligent machines has been a topic of interest for centuries.

## The Early Modern Period

  #### The development of mechanical calculators and other automated devices
  During the early modern period, there were significant advances in the development of mechanical calculators and other automated devices. These devices were designed to perform a range of tasks, from simple arithmetic operations to more complex calculations. One of the earliest examples of a mechanical calculator was the "Schickard Calculator," designed by Wilhelm Schickard in the 17th century. This device was able to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, using a system of gears and levers. In the 19th century, Charles Babbage designed the "Difference Engine," which was a more advanced mechanical calculator that could perform complex calculations using a system of wheels and cogs. These early mechanical calculators laid the foundation for the development of more advanced computing devices, such as the first digital computers.

  #### The emergence of cybernetics and the concept of feedback control 
  
  In the mid-20th century, the field of cybernetics emerged, which focused on the study of control and communication in living organisms and machines. The American mathematician Norbert Wiener is credited with coining the term "cybernetics" and developing the concept of feedback control, which is the process of using information about the output of a system to adjust the input and achieve a desired result. For example, in a feedback control system, if the output is not what was expected, the system can adjust the input to try to bring the output closer to the desired result. Cybernetics had a significant influence on the development of AI, as it provided a framework for understanding how intelligent systems can adapt and learn from their environment. The principles of cybernetics are still widely used in the design of AI systems today

## The Birth of Artificial Intelligence

  #### The development of the first digital computers and their impact on AI research 
  In the mid-20th century, the development of the first digital computers marked a major turning point in the field of AI. These early computers were much faster and more powerful than their mechanical counterparts, and they paved the way for more advanced AI programs and algorithms. One of the first digital computers, the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC), was developed in the 1940s and was used for a range of military and scientific applications. The development of digital computers sparked a wave of AI research, as scientists and engineers sought to develop programs and algorithms that could take advantage of the increased computing power.

  #### The creation of the first AI programs and algorithms 
  With the development of digital computers, researchers were able to create the first AI programs and algorithms. One of the earliest examples of an AI program was a machine translation system developed in the 1950s, which was able to translate simple sentences from one language to another. In the following decades, researchers developed a range of AI programs and algorithms that were able to perform tasks such as playing chess, solving mathematical problems, and recognizing patterns in data. These early AI programs laid the foundation for more advanced AI systems that we see today.

## The AI Boom

  #### The rapid development of AI in the 1980s and 1990s 
  In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a rapid explosion of AI research and development, which is often referred to as the "AI boom." During this period, there were numerous advances in the field, including the development of expert systems, which were computer programs that could mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in a specific domain. There were also significant advances in natural language processing, which is the ability of a computer to understand and generate human-like language. These and other developments led to a surge of interest in AI and sparked a wave of investment in the field.

  #### The emergence of machine learning and neural networks 
  One of the major developments during the AI boom was the emergence of machine learning, which is a type of AI that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms are able to analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that can be used to make predictions or decisions. Another important development during this period was the emergence of neural networks, which are computer systems that are designed to mimic the structure and function of the human brain. Neural networks can be trained to recognize patterns and make predictions based on that training. Neural networks have played a significant role in the development of modern AI systems.

## The AI Winter and Revival

  #### The slowdown in AI research in the late 1990s and early 2000s 
  After the initial excitement of the AI boom in the 1980s and 1990s, the field experienced a slowdown in research and development known as the "AI winter." This period was characterized by a decrease in funding and interest in AI, as many of the promises and hype surrounding the field failed to materialize. There were several factors that contributed to the AI winter, including the limited capabilities of early AI systems, the lack of progress in key areas such as natural language processing, and the high cost of developing and maintaining AI systems.

  The resurgence of AI in the 2010s thanks to advances in big data, cloud computing, and deep learning: In the 2010s, there was a resurgence of AI research and development, thanks in part to advances in big data, cloud computing, and deep learning. Big data refers to the vast amounts of data that are generated by businesses, governments, and individuals, and the ability to analyze and make sense of this data has been a key driver of the AI resurgence. Cloud computing has also played a significant role, as it has made it easier and more cost-effective to store and process large amounts of data. Finally, the development of deep learning algorithms, which are a type of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks on large amounts of data, has also contributed to the revival of AI. These and other factors have led to a renewed interest in AI and a surge of investment in the field.

## The Present and Future of AI

  #### Current applications of AI in fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. 
  
  AI has made significant inroads in a number of industries in recent years. In healthcare, for example, AI is being used to analyze medical images, such as X-rays and MRIs, to identify abnormalities that might be missed by human doctors. AI is also being used in the financial industry to analyze market trends, identify fraud, and make investment recommendations. In transportation, AI is being used to develop self-driving vehicles and to optimize routing and scheduling for delivery services. These are just a few examples of the many ways that AI is being applied in the present day. Some of the trending open AI systems are [**ChatGpt**](https://chat.openai.com/chat). which i used to help write this blog post.

  > Please note although the AI system can technically write a full article by itself. One needs to be the domain expert in order to fact check what it says is true. In order words there still needs a human driver to its capabilities. Which points to to fact that AI is meant to augment us not replace us. Atleast for now.

  #### Challenges and ethical concerns related to AI.
  As with any new technology, there are a number of challenges and ethical concerns related to AI. One of the main concerns is the potential for AI to displace human workers, particularly in industries where tasks can be automated. There are also concerns about the potential for AI to be used for nefarious purposes, such as surveillance or cyber attacks. Additionally, there are ethical questions about the use of AI in decision-making, such as whether it is fair to rely on AI systems that may be biased against certain groups. These and other challenges will need to be addressed as AI continues to develop and become more prevalent in society.

  #### Predictions for the future development of AI. 
  It is difficult to predict exactly how AI will develop in the future, but there are a number of trends and predictions that suggest where the field may be headed. One possibility is that AI will become more integrated into our daily lives, with smart assistants and other AI-powered devices becoming more prevalent in homes and workplaces. There is also the potential for AI to be used to address complex global challenges, such as climate change and disease outbreaks. Some experts predict that AI will eventually surpass human intelligence and become the dominant form of intelligence on the planet. Whether or not these predictions come true remains to be seen, but it is clear that AI will continue to play an increasingly important role in our lives.
